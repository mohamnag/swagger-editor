swagger-editor
==============

UI for an editor that can create and modify Swagger's API definition files.

This project is a collection of HTML, CSS and Javascript files that implement a simple editor for all pieces of the Swagger definition files.

WARNING: Still in early alpha, not useful yet.

(This project will "work" if you just open the index.html file in Firefox, but Chrome will not allow XmlHttpRequests from the filesystem; in this
case you need to deploy it to Apache or XAMPP).
